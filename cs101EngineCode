#// This is a code sample from the CS101 coursework of Peter Scheyer. Written in January and February of 2014,
#// this code is likely rife with errors and bugs and probably doesn't work and will need to be rewritten for
#// the specific purpose of inclusion in any worthwhile project.
#// that said, it is a place to start. And I have started there. //PJS 20140327 2157h//

#the below is my code from the CS101 homework where it asks you to finish the crawl_web procedure.

#Finish crawl web

    # The first version of my app will only be crawling my local copy of wikipedia.
    # I'll need to figure out how to access that file and the formatting conventions there at some point.
    # for now i'll do what i know and then later i can incorporate the wikipedia db, which i think is in html.
    #try:
    #   if url == "http://xkcd.com/353":
    #        return  except:
    #    return ""
